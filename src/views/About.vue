                  I currently reside in Southern Utah, with my wonderful family. I am a proud member of the Navajo tribe. I like to spend time with my family. I like to be outdoors. I hope to one day share my skill with my tribe and contribute to non-profit organizations. I am always learning new things and pushing myself to be better than the day before. My attention to detail and persistence allows me to build organized, clean code.

                  When I finished my first website it made me realize that Iâ€™m one step closer to achieving my goals and providing a better life for my family. From working in kitchens and metal shops, to joining an on-line program called Skillcrush, I am now a front-end web developer. What once started out as a hobby has now become my passion.
